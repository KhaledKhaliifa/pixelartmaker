# pixelartmaker
A simple pixel art maker written with HTML, CSS and JS

First, the grid is initialized as a 25 by 25 square, if we want to adjust that we can manually type in the height and width we would like in the "Height" and "Width" text boxes respectively and hit submit.
Then the grid is remade and all the changes are cleared.

Then we have 3 buttons: Draw, Erase, and Fill which allows the user to either draw on the canvas using the selected color, erase the color, or fill the entire canvas the selected color.

The user can also click and drag to draw not just click each pixel individually.
